#Note: This example performs QENIE on the liver-to-adipose circuit.
#Preproccesing of data from the original study (GSE64770) is listed in the README.md file

# Import secreted peptides
Secreted_proteins <- read.delim("Secreted_proteins_Uniprot.txt", header = T, check.names=F)

# Import your data
Adipose <- read.delim('adipose.txt', check.names=F)
Liver <- read.delim('liver.txt', check.names=F)

# Using these two datasets we will proceed:

# Construct cross-tissue correlation and pvalue matrices
liv.adip = bicorAndPvalue(Liver, Adipose, use='pairwise.complete.obs')

# Compute rowsum -log(pvalue) for ranking interactions and filter for factors proteins as secreted
scores = rowSums(-log(liv.adip$p))

# Retain only secreted peptides, normalize the Ssec score by number of target tissue probes (In this case, adipose contains 12242 genes)
# order by "sig score"
Ssec = data.frame(Gene_symbol = names(scores), score = scores) %>%
  filter(Gene_symbol %in% Secreted_proteins$`Gene names  (primary )`) %>%
  mutate(Ssec = score / length(scores)) %>%
  select(-score) %>%
  arrange(desc(Ssec))

write.table(Ssec, file="Liver X Adipose ranked by sig score", row.names=F, col.names=T, sep='\t', quote=F)

#This produces a table to each secreted protein and its respective significance score across adipose transcripts
#Note that Notum is listed as the 5th with an Sssec of 4.148
#For our pipeline, we next check the tissue-specificty using BioGPS - note that this step is not necessary, but makes us more confident when conditioning the pathway enrichment.  This moves Notum up to the 2nd ranked protein

#Condition correlation matrix on a by-gene basis for pathway enrichment - this example will focus on the protein, Notum
#remove gene of interest (Notum) from the correlation matrix
#the rownames of the file correspond to gene symbols for pathway enrichment, whereas the second column contains the bicor coefficent

bicor.data = melt(liv.adip$bicor)
colnames(bicor.data) = c('Gene_symbol_1', 'Gene_symbol_2', 'bicor')

  select(-Gene_symbol_1) %>%
  rename(Gene_symbol = Gene_symbol_2)

# Positively correlated pathways - "enhanced by protein"
upreg = Notum %>% arrange(desc(bicor)) %>% head(500)
